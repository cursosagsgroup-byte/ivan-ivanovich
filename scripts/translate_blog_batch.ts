        title: "Executive Protection: Between Knowing How to Shoot or How to Sell?",
        excerpt: "When we think about the skills a protector must have, the first thing that comes to mind are the spectacular executive protection courses...",
        content: `
<p>When we think about the skills a protector must have, the first thing that comes to mind are the spectacular <em>executive protection</em> courses in which participants use weapons of all calibers; perform all kinds of physical and motorized stunts; carry the executive in a "tie" hold while running and shooting at the same time; shoot from a moving vehicle and execute this entire repertoire of extremely fun practices that resemble nothing of their actual work activities. We are facing the famous "95 Fallacy", in which protective agents spend 95% of their time training in techniques that 95% of them will never use in their working life, and if they were to do so, they would fail in 95% of cases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the essential knowledge and skills that protectors use daily are not taught, or are taught very little. One of these skills is "sales skills". At this moment many will be surprised or even annoyed, since the "common" image of the protective agent is that of a warrior and not a merchant. However, if we do not understand that every human activity implies a sales effort, to a greater or lesser extent, we are lost. We all sell our work to our clients, to our bosses, and, in this case, to our protectees, so how we are valued will depend on it. Communication, persuasion, and convincing skills are essential in our work.</p>
<p>We have heard our colleagues complain countless times about how little they earn, the executive's unwillingness to invest in their security, or the lack of necessary equipment to do the job, for example. Users of <em>executive protection</em> are, generally, people with resources; we are witnesses to the investments they make, by the millions, in different projects. However, their refusal to invest even a fraction in both their own safety and that of their loved ones is surprising. Definitely, something does not add up here. But the answer is simple: there are resources, but we don't know how to sell.</p>
<p>Most likely this may annoy many, as we like to offload our responsibilities onto others and not assume them ourselves, but it is precisely what we must not do if we want our profession to be more respected and better paid. Poor "sales" skill is one of the big problems of current <em>executive protection</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, to be able to sell something you need at least two things: a good product and sales skills. Executives, for the most part, are intelligent, practical, and skillful people who understand and accept well-founded reasons and concepts.</p>
<p>The big problem, on the other hand, is that traditional <em>executive protection</em> is a difficult product to sell when offered to an intelligent person. That is, generally, traditional and reactive protection is not based on logic or hard data, as I explained in this article:</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very difficult to sell something illogical to someone rational.</p>
<p>Many executives we have spoken with have gone so far as to point out that they do not want to invest in more salaries or more weapons or patrols, because they say that if "they come for them" they will do so with everything and their protective agents, and they also cite several examples where executives were killed or kidnapped despite their security team, which either failed to react or did not do so adequately. We must accept, however, that this is a complicated argument to refute from both a historical and statistical point of view.</p>
<p>In this same sense, some of them told us that they mainly employ their protectors to deter the most common and "benign" crimes, so they do not consider it prudent to make a more serious investment. Others, in turn, prefer not to use protective agents and opt for a "low profile", a fallacy we explain in this video:</p>
<p>Of course, the attitudes of these executives are dangerous for both them and their protectors; for this reason, we need a new "product", a new concept of protection that is clear, logical, effective, and supported by hard data, while being easy to understand and with a clear cost/benefit concept acceptable to the executive. This is explained in detail in the book <em>Executive Protection in the 21st Century: The New Doctrine.</em></p>
<p>Once we master this concept, we have to train ourselves in different persuasion techniques, convincing methods, and other methods related to our skills to sell and negotiate with our client, who, being capable and reasonable people, after a good negotiation, always end up accepting well-founded concepts.</p>
<p>Of course, there are always foolish and irrational users, who, many times, even become rude; however, in our experience, they represent a minority with whom it is better not to work if we wish to preserve our reputation.</p>
<p>Our training must be focused more and more on these skills.</p>

        title: "Counter-Surveillance in Executive Protection: Most Important but Least Used",
        excerpt: "Several months ago I wrote an article about the non-existent prevention structure in executive protection, placing particular emphasis on the absence of...",
        content: `
<p>Several months ago I wrote an article about the non-existent prevention structure in <em>executive protection</em>, placing particular emphasis on the absence of counter-surveillance in daily operations, to which some colleagues commented that the counter-surveillance measure is a method known in Mexico for many years. Of course, I never said that I \"invented\" counter-surveillance, nor that it is something unknown to professionals; but, I insist, it is a method almost totally out of use in the vast majority of security groups currently operating.</p>
<p>The regrettable attacks that have occurred lately in Mexico City are proving me right. In the attacks on Norberto Rivera's house in 2018, on the Secretary of Citizen Security, Omar García Harfuch, in 2020 and in the most recent attack against restaurant businessman Eduardo Beaven, in the vicinity of the capital's airport, subsequent investigations have shown that the victims were objects of hostile surveillance by criminals months before the aggression, without having been detected in a timely manner.</p>
<p>As we well know, the attack on an executive lasts only a few moments, but the preparation for this attack implies prolonged observation and monitoring against the victim by criminals, a process that, as we could see, can last months. Counter-surveillance detects and deactivates the attack in this early phase of observation without exposing the protectee to the risks and uncertainty that reaction implies.</p>
<p>If there had been a structured counter-surveillance system in the cases mentioned, specialists in this technique would have detected the presence of criminals and deactivated the attack months before it was executed, thus avoiding human losses. We explain these techniques with real examples in the book <em>Executive Protection in the 21st Century, The New Doctrine.</em></p>
<p>What else has to happen for us to leave the dangerous fantasies of weapons and reaction and shift the operational weight in <em>executive protection</em> towards counter-surveillance and early warning methods to avoid the loss of lives of both protectees and their protectors?</p>

        title: "Executive Protection Training: An Amusement Park",
        excerpt: "Executive protection training could undoubtedly be considered a postmodern activity, since in it fantasy and imagination prevail over reality...",
        content: `
<p>Training in <em>executive protection</em> could undoubtedly be considered a postmodern activity, since in it fantasy and imagination prevail over reality. This profession is also, probably, the only one where protectors are trained in something they will perhaps never use in their working life, while the things that are done, or should be done daily, are not part of a study curriculum in most training institutions.</p>
<p>We say that protective agent training is dominated by the \"95 Fallacy\", where 95% of training time is dedicated to activities that 95% of operators will never perform in their lives, and, if they do, they will fail in 95% of cases, regardless of their level of preparation.</p>
<p>The training market for this discipline has become an amusement park. Training courses for protective agents are generally spectacular: All types of weapons are fired, sometimes from moving vehicles or carrying the principal; all kinds of physical and motorized maneuvers are performed; there are crashes and, sometimes, vehicles are even burned; \"karate chops\" are given, or rescues and scenes that not even Hollywood has managed to recreate are simulated. The rule is simple: the more spectacle, the more sales.</p>
<p>Of course we all enjoy these events very much; however, <em>executive protection</em> is not Disneyland for security agents, but a profession that is too serious where the lives of executives, protective agents and citizens in general are at stake at all times.</p>
<p>This type of training is not only not very helpful in operation, since the measures taught there have an effectiveness in real conditions of only 5%, but also partially harmful, since on many occasions it leads to failure. This, first of all, by favoring a reactive approach by reducing the strategy to only waiting for an ambush to react, where the protectors' chances are minimal or null.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the \"amusement park\" becomes the only answer to all kinds of situations, which has generated great damage and has also claimed lives. The famous protective agent of singer Lucero drew his weapon against journalists, generating a great scandal. He was \"crucified\" in the media, but not all the blame was his. If he was taught that his only tool is the weapon, without teaching him other methods, the only thing he will use in any adverse situation is the weapon.</p>
<p>Adolfo Lagos' armed driver involuntarily killed his protectee while defending him from an assault, by shooting while driving. This action looks very good in the \"amusement park\", but, in real life, it turned out tragic. Something similar happened during the assault on Sergio \"Checo\" Pérez's protective agent, where a protector was seriously injured.</p>
<p>With this training, making a spectacle in real life becomes something aspirational for the protector, who sometimes seeks and even provokes this type of event so that the situation he fantasizes about during training is reached, only that, in reality, the genre of the movie changes from a successful <em>thriller</em> to a great tragedy.</p>
<p>Of course I don't mean to say that this type of training is useless, or that it shouldn't be implemented. It is clear that the protector must know reactive measures in the same way that a pilot practices how to deal with various emergencies in a simulator. The big problem is that <em>executive protection</em> is not and should not be emergencies, but rather how to avoid them.</p>
<p>This is why training in <em>executive protection</em> must be dominated by the 45-45-10 rule; that is, 45% of training time must be focused on mastering the knowledge and skills used in the daily work of a protector, another 45% must be focused on mastering the strategies and practices that allow us to avoid risk situations, while the remaining 10% must focus on handling emergencies. Only in this way can we achieve a safer profession for both executives and protectors.</p>

        content: `
<p>Deterrence was undoubtedly one of the pillars of traditional <em>executive protection</em>. Weapons, patrols, and numerous intimidating agents aimed to discourage any hostile person or group that could represent a threat to the protectee. However, like most measures used previously in our profession, this one was also overestimated. It should be clarified that no one questions that deterrence has its advantages, but, in our work, today, it has at least three major problems:</p>
<p>1. Limited, questionable, and difficult to quantify scope. in the words of Olivera Ćirković, former member of the famous international gang the <em>Pink Panthers</em>, deterrence can discourage petty criminals, but not organized and well-structured groups, if they consider that the objective is worth the risk. Eighteen armed protective agents failed to deter gunmen and prevent the assassination of Luis Carlos Galán, presidential candidate of Colombia. Likewise, not even the entire US Secret Service managed to deter John Hinckley from attempting to kill Ronald Reagan; just as Israeli security did not discourage Yigal Amir from assassinating Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. So not only organized groups; determined individuals are also not always discouraged by the spectacle of deterrence.</p>
<p>2. The executive's image in the digital age. The digital revolution and the growing influence of social networks made today's executives begin to reject the classic paraphernalia of suited agents with dark glasses and threatening attitude to protect their image before an increasingly horizontal society. What was once a status symbol has now become one of bad taste.</p>
<p>3. It is not a financially intelligent concept. To deter more than the "common" mugger, a robust system of at least two or more people, weapons, patrols, and specific equipment is required, which implies a high cost, but, as we already said, its scope is very limited and difficult to quantify. If we add to this the fact that weapons and reaction in <em>executive protection</em> have a scope of only 5% in real conditions, using this type of measure entails a disadvantage when considering its cost/benefit, which is why more and more executives reject its implementation.</p>
<p>Of course, whether deterrence is to be used or not, and to what extent, depends on a specific risk study for each case. Here, in general terms, we want to point out the advantages and disadvantages of said concept to help professionals design their operations. However, techniques such as intelligence, counter-surveillance, and early warning will always be much more effective, more discreet, and, of course, cheaper solutions.</p>

        title: "Airport Attack: Armored Vehicles, Not Shootouts, Are the Basis of Secure Transport",
        excerpt: "Not even a month has passed since a shootout broke out during an attempted vehicle theft in the Santa Fe area of Mexico City, where...",
        content: `
<p>Not even a month has passed since a shootout broke out during an attempted vehicle theft in the Santa Fe area of Mexico City, where a protective agent was seriously injured while repelling the aggression from his vehicle (unarmored), when another very similar regrettable case has already occurred.</p>
<p>This Friday, October 15, two men on a motorcycle attacked a luxury SUV with gunfire, also unarmored, in which businessman Eduardo Beaven, owner of a restaurant chain, was traveling as a passenger. He, along with his protective agent, was injured and taken to a hospital in the Observatorio area. The unit received several bullet impacts, while the motorcycle used by the assailants was severely damaged after being dragged several meters on the asphalt.</p>
<p>This time the driver, using the vehicle as a defensive weapon, ran over and dragged the aggressors through the roundabout of terminal number 2 of the Mexico City International Airport (AICM). One of the criminals lost his life minutes after being admitted to the hospital due to injuries caused during the attempted assault; the other subjects who managed to flee are being sought by agents of the Mexico City Secretariat of Security. Both the businessman and his protective agent are stable after the mishap.</p>
<p>Journalistic reports also indicate that the aggression was repelled with a firearm from the attacked vehicle.</p>
<p>From this regrettable situation we can draw two conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The best weapon available to a properly trained security driver is their vehicle.</li>
<li>To reduce the risks of an assault or an attack, the armored vehicle is an essential tool that cannot be replaced by a firearm which, in an unarmored vehicle, can generate more problems than solutions, as we have seen in other assault cases; such examples are the aggressions against Sergio "Checo" Pérez's protective agent, or as in the recent shootouts in Santa Fe and at the Airport.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Executive protection</em> is a planning and logistics process with the objective of reducing the user's exposure to risk, but not to expose them to shootouts, sometimes gratuitous, where their life is at stake. Each tool in <em>executive protection</em> has its reason for being within the operational scheme and we cannot use one to replace the other or to try to save resources, which is often done when trying to replace an armored vehicle with an armed agent.</p>
<p>Only the proper combination of different tools can reduce risks to an optimal level within an <em>executive protection</em> scheme.</p>
