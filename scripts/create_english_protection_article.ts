<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study evaluates the historical effectiveness of various measures used in Executive Protection through the analysis of 141 verified assassination attempts against high-level political and public figures, occurring between 1900 and 2025 in over 60 countries. The <strong>Circumstantial Effectiveness Index (CEI)</strong> is calculated for firearms, empty-hand techniques, armored vehicles, defensive driving, and other reactive close protection measures. The results confirm that reaction tools and tactics (weapons, large escorts, close combat) have a combined effectiveness of only <strong>17.73%</strong>, failing in over 80% of the studied attacks. In contrast, anticipatory measures—such as surveillance, counter-surveillance, and early warning—although historically underutilized, demonstrate significant potential for thwarting attacks before execution. Rigorous verification through multiple historical sources ensures reliability. The findings propose a paradigm shift: from a model centered on weapons and reaction to an intelligence-enabled, preventive, and logistical model.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> executive protection, effectiveness, assassination attempts, historical analysis, preventive strategies, intelligence, counter-surveillance.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In contemporary practice, both protectors and protectees often assume that firearms constitute the central element of executive protection. This perception persists despite the absence of robust empirical evidence to support it. Part of this view stems from cultural narratives, especially cinema, fiction, and isolated anecdotes. Scientifically evaluating the effectiveness of these tools is complex due to the lack of systematic data. For example, in Mexico alone, INEGI reports 2,877 executives and officials assassinated in recent decades, but there is no complete information on how many had armed security, nor in how many cases their escorts could influence the outcome. On a global scale, an exhaustive census is unfeasible.</p>

<p>Therefore, this study adopts a representative sample: <strong>141 historically verifiable assassination attempts with confirmed presence of professional armed security</strong>. Multiple sources—encyclopedic databases, academic archives, and journalistic reports—were used to ensure historical precision and consistency.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>2.1 Case Selection</h3>
<p>The 141 cases were selected following strict criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universality:</strong> more than 60 countries.</li>
<li><strong>Verifiability:</strong> cases documented and widely recorded in historical sources.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal significance:</strong> over 125 years of observation.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of protection:</strong> victims with official, armed, and professional security.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance of position:</strong> heads of state, prime ministers, princes, high officials, presidential candidates, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusion:</strong> kidnappings and undocumented assaults due to lack of comparable operational data.</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria ensure that the study observes only situations with a high standard of protection, reducing the possibility of attributing failures to improvisation or structural incompetence.</p>

<h3>2.2 Analysis Categories</h3>
<p>The assassination attempts were classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-fatal attempts (74 cases)</li>
<li>Consummated assassinations (67 cases)</li>
</ul>
<p>Effectiveness evaluation considers a measure as decisive only when its application directly ensures the protectee's survival, without relying on luck or attacker errors.</p>

<h3>2.3 Circumstantial Effectiveness Index (CEI)</h3>
<p>The CEI is defined as:</p>
<p><strong>CEI = (Number of cases where the measure was decisive / Number of applicable cases) × 100</strong></p>
<p><strong>Applicable cases:</strong> situations where the tool could reasonably intervene based on distance, attack type, and operational context.</p>
<p>Estimated distances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short (&lt;7 m): 93 cases (65.96%).</li>
<li>Long (&gt;7 m): 48 cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distance was determined through historical reconstructions, official descriptions, and reports from the scene.</p>

<h3>2.4 Data Verification</h3>
<p>Each case was corroborated across multiple sources. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early 20th century: attacks on Edward of Wales (1900), Leopold II (1902).</li>
<li>Successful manual reaction: Lenin (1918), Mussolini (1926), Reagan (1981), Rabin (1995).</li>
<li>Decisive weapons: Truman (1950), De Gaulle (1961–62), Pinochet (1986), Mubarak (1995), Karzai (2002).</li>
<li>Failures with large teams: Galán (1989, 18 escorts), Cabrera Barrientos (2024, 15 escorts), Carlos Manzo (2025, ~20 escorts).</li>
</ul>
<p>No significant contradictions were found among consulted sources.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>3.1 General Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>Non-fatal attempts: 74 (52.48%)</li>
<li>Consummated assassinations: 67 (47.52%)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Effectiveness by Measure</h3>
<h4>Firearms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Global CEI: <strong>3.55%</strong> (5/141)</li>
<li>At short distance (&lt;7 m): <strong>0%</strong> (0/93)</li>
<li>At long distance (&gt;7 m): <strong>10.42%</strong> (5/48)</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, the attack occurs too quickly for an effective armed response. Nonetheless, the few successful cases show that weapons should not be discarded but placed in their real context: a low-performance tool with exceptional applications.</p>

<h4>Empty-Hand Techniques</h4>
<ul>
<li>CEI: <strong>32.61%</strong> (15/46 applicable cases)</li>
</ul>
<p>They work primarily against lone attackers in crowds and at extremely short distances. They are not a substitute for early detection but a useful resource in immediate contact scenarios.</p>

<h4>Armored Vehicles and Defensive Driving</h4>
<ul>
<li>CEI: <strong>100%</strong> (5/5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Armored vehicles stand out as one of the few measures with absolute performance when conditions allow their application. Emblematic cases: De Gaulle 1961–62, Aznar 1995, Shevardnadze 1998.</p>

<h4>Cumulative Effectiveness of Close Protection Measures</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>17.73%</strong> combined effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>(Includes weapons, empty hands, armored vehicles, and immediate reaction devices.) This implies that over 80% of attacks overcame traditional close protection schemes, even in robust and highly trained teams. Critical examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Luis Carlos Galán (1989) with 18 armed agents.</li>
<li>Cabrera Barrientos (2024) with 15 federal agents.</li>
<li>Carlos Manzo (2025) with ~20 agents from Guardia Nacional and policía federal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The size of the operation does not compensate for preventive deficiencies.</p>

<h4>Anticipatory Measures (Historically Underutilized)</h4>
<p><strong>Early Warning</strong> Decisive in one of the few documented cases of structured application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donald Trump, September 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Critical Omission: Anticipatory Protection</h2>
<p>The study reveals that, over 125 years, Executive Protection has been dominated by:</p>
<ul>
<li>weapons,</li>
<li>reaction,</li>
<li>physical presence,</li>
<li>large number of agents.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, historical analysis shows that: Most attackers conducted prior surveillance, sometimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>days,</li>
<li>weeks,</li>
<li>months before.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was evident in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both attacks on Donald Trump (2024)</li>
<li>Dozens of planned ambushes from 1900 to today.</li>
</ul>
<p>In no reviewed case is the systematic implementation of professional counter-surveillance documented, despite being one of the most effective methods in modern security theory. <strong>The historical absence of anticipatory detection constitutes the main structural cause of failure in the traditional executive protection system.</strong></p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The results align with contemporary operational findings, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tueller Drill, which demonstrates that an attacker at short distance systematically overcomes armed reaction speed.</li>
<li>Cases like Sadat (1981) and Galán (1989) prove that even a large deployment becomes irrelevant without anticipation.</li>
<li>The success of early warning in September 2024 shows the difference between a reactive and an anticipatory model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The study excludes undocumented events.</li>
<li>The CEI describes contextual effectiveness, not absolute.</li>
<li>Future research can expand the database and employ operational simulations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The data are unequivocal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firearms are not the central measure of executive protection.</strong> With 3.55% historical effectiveness, their utility is marginal and should be understood as a complementary resource, not structural.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipatory prevention is the key to the future.</strong> The analysis suggests that up to 80% of assassination attempts could have been thwarted with a systematic combination of:
    <ul>
    <li>Counter-surveillance / surveillance detection</li>
    <li>Early warning</li>
    <li>Protective logistics</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reactive measures are insufficient.</strong> The combined effectiveness of 17.73% demonstrates that reaction is late in most contexts.</li>
<li><strong>21st Century Executive Protection must be:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Intelligence-enabled,</li>
    <li>Predictive,</li>
    <li>Logistical,</li>
    <li>Based on anticipation, not armament.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
